# StockWatch

## Overview: 
A real-time stock market information application. Users can get real-time stock updates (15min delay) on stocks across a variety of exchanges. Users can get news, see additional information about the stock such as volume traded and company background, and add stock to a watchlist.  Watch-listed stocks appear on the user’s home page and can provide notifications once a specified price is reached.
